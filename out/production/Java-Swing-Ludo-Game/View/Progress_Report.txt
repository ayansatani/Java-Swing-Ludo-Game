Guntas started working on the GUI for the game. It was mutually decided by the developers to follow the MVC(Model-View-Control) 
architectural model, hence the name of the packages. Initially all the components for the GUI were initialised, stored and manipulated 
in the 'View.Gameboard.java' file and compiled and run in 'Control.Main.java' but for the purpose of easy handling and maintenance of 
the code 'View.Gameboard.java' was broken down into 5 classes under view package: RedHomeBase.java, BlueHomeBase.java, 
YellowHomeBase.java, and GreenHomeBase.java.

Guntas added the ChatPanel.java(chat area), DicePanel.java(dice roll), and MenuBar.java(menu bar) upon the request of other 
contributors. Functionality was added to help, about, and exit buttons on the menubar using Control.MenuController.java.
